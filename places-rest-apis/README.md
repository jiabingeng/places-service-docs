Places is the set of services that makes it easier for Adobe customers to hydrate the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Experience Platform solutions with location data and the right experience to the right person at the right time and in the right place.

The Places services allows you to do the following:

* Manage geofences
* Measure the location of users even when app is in the background
* Use data in real-time when it matters

This section provides information about how to use the REST APIs and the Places database, which contains your org's POI data.

## Places REST API

The Places REST APIs let you work programmatically with your organization's POIs. These APIs allow you to create, update, and delete your libraries and the POIs in those libraries. These APIs use JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) standards to format the data that is sent and received. A principal advantage of JSON is that it makes API queries easy to write, read, and parse by developers and machines.

Before you can use the Places API, you will need to complete the prerequistes found on this page. [Integration overview and prerequisites](adobe-i-o-integration/).

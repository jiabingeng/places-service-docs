The batch APIs allow you to create, update, or delete multiple POIs at the same time.

To help you complete a batch import of your POIs from a `.csv` file into your organization's Places database, we created a set of Python scripts. You can download the zip file of these scripts [here](https://github.com/adobe/places-scripts). For instructions on how to use the scripts, see the included README file.

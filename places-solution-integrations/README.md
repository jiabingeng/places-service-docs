# Places Solution Integrations

Using Places alone to collect location data is not useful in your app. The real value comes from location data that you provide to other Adobe solutions. You can use this data to deliver custom experiences and make informed decisions.

This section provides information about how to integrate Places with other Mobile SDK extensions, so you can put your location data to work.

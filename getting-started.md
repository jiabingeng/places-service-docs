# Getting started

## Get provisioned to use Adobe Places

Places requires special provisioning context with your regular Adobe Experience Platform provisioning context.

To get provisioned, complete the following tasks:

* In the Admin Console, ensure that your organization is provisioned with Places.   If you are not the Adobe administrator, contact the administrator to ensure the Places context in Admin Console.
* Ensure you are listed as a user under the Places and Launch product contexts in the Admin Console.  For more information, see [Adding a user to Launch and Places](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/adding-a-user-to-launch-and-places).
* Ensure your mobile app property is configured in Experience Platform Launch with the Places extension installed.   For more information, see [Places extension](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-extension). 
* If your company has multiple Adobe organizations, ensure that you always select the organization that is provisioned for Places.  This allows you to add your POIs and Libraries.

## Configure the Places extension and Places Monitor extension

For more information about configuring the Places extension and Monitor extension, see [Places extension](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-extension) and [Places Monitor extension](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/configure-places-in-the-sdk/places-monitor-extension).

## Creating libraries and POIs

You can create libraries and POIs in one of the following ways:

* By using the web services.  For more information, see [Places web services](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/places-rest-apis).
* By using the Places UI.  For more information, see [Places UI](https://placesdocs.com/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/places-database-management-1).

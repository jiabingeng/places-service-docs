# Release notes

## February 28, 2019

### Beta Release

This is the first release of Adobe Location Services, a set of tools that allows customers to enrich their users' experiences with real world location data. For the first release, our primary use case is to enable mobile apps to retrieve custom location data and act on that data through Adobe Launch.

### Key features

Here are the key features in this release:

#### Places UI 

We have released a management UI where you can view and manage your Points of Interest \(POIs\). You also can organize your POIs into libraries. In addition to standard metadata such as city, state, and category, we also support the ability to add custom metadata to your POIs.

* To see the Places UI, go to [https://places.adobe.com](https://places.adobe.com). 
* To get started with the Places UI, see [Getting Started](https://launch.gitbook.io/places-services-by-adobe-documentation/getting-started).

#### Places Launch Extension 

Using the Places Launch Extension, you can add your Places libraries to your mobile app and act on their POIs. Using the rule builder in Launch, you can trigger actions to fire when users enter and exit POIs.

In the Places extension: 

* You can choose which POI libraries to include on your app.
* Rule events that trigger on POI entry or exit.
* Create data elements that point to the user's current POI.

For more information about the Places extension, see [Places extension](https://launch.gitbook.io/launch-adobe-mobile-sdk-beta/v/places/) guide.

#### Places APIs 

We have a complete set of easy-to-use APIs that developers can use to populate and update their list of POIs. All of the APIs that are used by the Places UI are available for our customers. If you want to, you can  build your own UI or integrate with an existing POI database. You can also use Places API `batch` endpoints to do bulk import of POIs. A python utility is provided with the APIs.

For more information about the Places APIs, see [Places REST API](https://launch.gitbook.io/places-developer-by-adobe-documentation/) guide.

### Coming Soon

#### Places Monitor Extension 

In the next couple weeks, we will be launching the Places Monitor extension, which will automatically handle the registration and monitoring of POIs in Android and iOS.

#### Analytics Integration 

The Analytics Launch extension is being updated to automatically add location data to all outgoing Analytics when a user is within a POI. This update also allows rule creation to fire Analytics track calls directly at POI entry or exit.

Bulk uploading POIs
=================
A set of Python scripts have been created to simplify the batch import of POIs from a .csv file into a POI database by using the Web Service APIs. These scripts can be downloaded from this open source [git repo](https://github.com/adobe/places-scripts). 

Before you run these scripts, to access the Web Services APIs, check [Integration overview and prerequisites](../places-rest-apis/adobe-i-o-integration/README.md).

Here is some information about the scipts. 

**Tip**: This information is also included in a readme file in the [git repo](https://github.com/adobe/places-scripts).

## CSV file

A sample .csv file, `places_sample.csv`, is part of this package and includes the required headers and a row of sample data. These headers are all lower case and correspond to the reserved metatdata keys that are used in the Places database. Columns that you add to the csv file will be added to the POI database in a separate metadata section for each POI as key/value pairs, and the header value is used as the key.

Here is a list of the columns and the values that you need to use:

* lib_id

  A valid library ID that is obtained from the POI database.

* type

  Point is currently the only valid value.

* longitude

  A value between -180 and 180.

* latitude

  A value between -85 and 85.

* radius

  A value between 10 and 20,000.

**Column values**

The values of the following columns are used in the Location Service UI:

* color, which is used as the color of the pin that represents the location of the POI in the Location Service UI map.
  - The valid values are "", #3E76D0, #AA99E8, #DC2ABA, #FC685B, #FC962E, #F6C436, #BECE5D, #61B56B, and #3DC8DE.
  - If the value is left blank, the Location Service UI uses blue as the default color.
    
    The values correspond to blue ( #3E76D0), purple (#AA99E8), fuschia (#DC2ABA), orange (#FC685B), light orange (#FC962E), yellow (#F6C436), light green (#BECE5D), green (#61B56B), and light blue (#3DC8DE), respectively.
  
* icon, which is used as the icon on the pin that represents the location of the POI on the Location Service UI map
  - The valid values are "", shop, hotelbed, car, airplane, train, ship, stadium, amusementpark, anchor, beaker, bell, bid, book, box, briefcase, browse, brush, building, calculator, camera, clock, education, flashlight, follow, game, female, male, gift, hammer, heart, home, key, launch, lightbulb, mailbox, money, pin, promote, ribbon, shoppingCart, star, target, teapot, thumbDown, thumbUp, trap, trophy, wrench.
  - If the value is left blank, the UI uses heart as the default icon.

* Columns that are not mentioned can be left blank.


Running the Script
-------------
1. Download files from the [git repo](https://github.com/adobe/places-scripts) to your local directory.
1. In a text editor, open the `config.py` file and complete the following tasks:
   1. Edit the following variable values as strings:

      * `csv_file_path`

        The path to your `.csv`  file.

      * `access_code`
      
        This is your access code that was obtained from the call to Adobe IMS. For information about how to obtain this access code, see [Integration overview and prerequisites](../places-rest-apis/adobe-i-o-integration/README.md) . 
      
      * `org_id`
      
        The Experience Cloud orgID into which the POIs are to be imported. For information about how to obtain the org ID, see [Integration overview and prerequisites](../places-rest-apis/adobe-i-o-integration/README.md).
      
      * `api_key`
      
        This is your Places REST API key obtained from your Adobe I/O Places Integration. For information about how to obtain the API key, see [Integration overview and prerequisites](../places-rest-apis/adobe-i-o-integration/README.md).

    1. Save your changes.
1. In a terminal window, navigate to the `â€¦/places-scripts/import/` directory.
1. Enter `python ./places_import.py` and press the **enter** (**return**) key.


Pre-import CSV checks
------------
The script initially completes the following checks on the .csv file:

- Whether a `.csv` file was specified.
- Whether the file path is valid.
- Whether the reserved metatdata headers are included.

  The reserved metadata headers are lib_id, name, description, type, longitude, latitude, radius, country, state, city, street, category, icon, and color.

  **Tip**: The headers are all lower case and can be listed in any order.

- Verifies the values of the columns specified in the CSV file section.

If errors are found, the script prints out the errors and is aborted. If no errors are found, the script attempts to import the POIs in batches of 1000. If the batch is successfully imported, the script reports a status code of 200. If the batch is not successfully imported, errors are reported.
